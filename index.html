            <h1>Today I Made a Website<br>
              <small> Saturday, September 19, 2015</small>
            </h1>
            <p>I finally did it. All this time I've had thoughts and no where to put them. Today is the day I change that. I have decided to liberate my mind, and expose it to the world for everyone to praise (or critique). I've decided to code it from scratch, using the experience I gained using bootstrap to make <a href="www.ubcaerodesign.com">UBC AeroDesign's webpage</a>, and pair it with the Javascript I learned to make hipster-feed (more on that in a future blog post!). It's fun learning to use jQuery to make things like my super-ridiculously-over-the-top menu bar. Seriously, stop readind this and check it our right now. Cool right? <br><br>Expect this site to contain my progress and thought processes on my various random projects, and philosophies on anything and everything. The site is still in developement, so a lot of functionality isn't working. Of course, it isn't online right now either -- I'm literally writing a post just to see how the formating will fit in -- but once I do upload the site, it still may not be completed. Who knows who may have stumbled accross this website!<br><br>Anyways, I'll keep you all in the loop on my progress. Thanks for checking it, and I hope you enjoy the site!</p>
